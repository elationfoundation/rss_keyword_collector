A simple rss based news website scraper and keyword identifier. It is intended to track a series of news rss feeds to be paired with a keyword based censorship detector. It at a specified interval checks all the rss feeds it has for new articles and then uses generic (or website specific) scrapers to download the body text of the article. Once this is done it uses a language specific keyword parser (only English, Persian, and a generic fallback implemented so far) to create a list of keywords (removing stop-words, etc) and put them into a database and a file for each unique keywords-to-article set. At another interval it creates keyword files containing currently uncensored and censored keywords.

This service is intended to allow us to connect periods of censorship of certain keywords to possible surrounding media events. It will be rough, but with enough feeds it will allow people to start building narratives around the censorship events.
